# Task 1: Cloud Storage Setup

## Concept Demonstrated
Cloud storage allows storing files remotely that can be accessed from anywhere via internet.

## How It Would Work on AWS S3/Google Cloud:
1. Create a storage bucket
2. Upload files to the bucket
3. Configure access permissions (public/private)
4. Access files via unique URLs

## Sample Implementation Details:
- Bucket Name: codtech-internship-storage
- Files: sample-file.txt, document.pdf, image.jpg
- Permissions: Mixed (some public, some private)

## Real-world Use Cases:
- Hosting website static files
- Storing user uploads
- Backup and archiving
